Shy is a multipurpose tool, in which was firstly named Lazy.

It contacts Roblox's API, generates passwords on a targeted email and sends a response code showing if the
brute-force was successful or not, longest time brute-forcing an account was 3 hours, shortest time recorded
was around 37 minutes.

Shy uses a special brute-force method, please be patient and give it time.

Files may come back as false-positive;

Have you ever took a test and it came back negative even though you were positive?

Yup, just like that.
